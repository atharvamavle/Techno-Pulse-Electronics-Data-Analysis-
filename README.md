This report provides a comprehensive analysis of data from TechnoPulse Electronics (TPE), with charts, graphics, and tables included exclusively in the accompanying Data Analysis file (Excel spreadsheet) for reference. The analysis focuses on warehouse operations, sales performance, and customer ratings, summarizing key variables using descriptive statistics and identifying trends and outliers in sales and customer review proportions. We investigated the relationship between manager gender and customer ratings, highlighting significant findings. Additionally, annual sales managed by male warehouse managers were calculated and compared. Finally, the required sample size to analyze the proportion of warehouses with high customer reviews at a 95% confidence level was determined to ensure reliable insights for strategic planning.
